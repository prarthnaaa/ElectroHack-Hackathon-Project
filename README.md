# Weed Detection & Autonomous Navigation Robot

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered autonomous robot designed for smart weed detection and navigation, developed as part of the ElectroHack hackathon organised by IEEE Circuits and Systems Student's Chapter VIT.

## Features
- 🌱 **Machine Learning Model**: Identifies weeds using image processing.
- 🛠 **FPGA Path Planning**: Implements autonomous navigation using Verilog.
- 🤖 **Walking Robot**: Controlled via Arduino for movement.

## My Contribution
Developed the Machine Learning model for weed detection using image processing, achieving 98.46% accuracy (20 epochs) and 91.15% accuracy (15 epochs) through model optimization and tuning across multiple training cycles.
